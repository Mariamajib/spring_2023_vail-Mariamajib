# Deep Learning and TensorFlow

## Topics covered in today's module
* Linear models in machine learning
* Introduction to TensorFlow
* Dataloaders
* Building a simple Neural Network

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* Machine Learning Models
  * Linear Regression Models: used for determining the line of best fit of data by estimation.
  * Neural Network Model: for classification through training and labels of data using tensor to build, train, and deploy neural networks.
    * The lower the loss, the more likely the accuracy of the prediction.

* Activation Functions 
  * Sigmoid is used for two outputs (binary classification) with probabilty range of 0 and 1.
  * Softmax is used for multi-class classification.

* Keras is a function used for the creation of layer by layer neural networks.

* Shapes of Tensors 
  * Scalar - 0 tensor
  * Vector - 1 tensor
  * Matrix - 2 tensors
  * Cube of matrices - 3 tensors

* Normalization by bringing all values of datasets to common scale to speed up the learning which leads to faster convergence of predicted images.
  

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* It was interesting to see the visualizations of the machine learning algorithm framework learnt on Day 1 (Machine Learning) for the prediction using Computer vision
