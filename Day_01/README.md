# Machine Learning

## Topics covered in today's module

* Introduction to Machine Learning
* Machine learning with Scikit-learn
* Decision Trees
* Linear Regression
* Random Forests

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment

* The types of Machine learning 
  * Supervised - Regression and classification
  * Unsupervised - Clustering
  * Reinforcement - Gaming, Inventory management, Robotic Navigation 

* Scikit Learn is a open source for supervised and unsupervised learning

* Supervised learning algorithms 
  * Decision trees
  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forest

* Linear regression output is in numerical form while decision tree output is in classification form.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment

* It was interesting seeing the visualization of Decision Tree and Random Forest models, discovering the differences and similarities between Random Forest and Decision Trees.

* Learning about other math and data libraries in Python as side from Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy I am familar with 
  * SciPy: scientific and technical computing 
  * Ipython: interactive console for python
  * SymPy: symbolic mathematics 

* The Maths for Machine Learning Maps showing the connectivities between Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Calculus, Optimization, Linear Algebra, and Probability & Statistics.
